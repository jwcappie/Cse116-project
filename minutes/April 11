Meeting Minutes for April 11th:

Meeting Attendance:
	1. Justin Cappiello
	2. Robert Straub [M]
	3. Abdullah Abaddi
	4. Aritra Paul
	
Tasks Completed Since Last Meeting:
	1. Count & clue implemented for the spymaster's turn by Justin
		- If the clue or count is an illegal value it will return an error message to the user asking to re-input allowed values.
	2. After the legal values are inputed the turn switches to the other team memeber's turn to select the location.
	3. Locations are now click-able and turns are now switch-able by Justin
	
Tasks Worked Upon but not Completed:
	1. Need to implement winning methods that will end the game when the game is put into one of the winning states.
		- Winning states include when one team gets all the right locations, or if the assassin is picked.
	2. Improve on the way the game switches between team members.
		- Need to add a buffer of sorts between each team member so the board is not accidentally revealed.
	3. Count
		- Once the count reaches 0 the turn should end.
	
Goals for Next Meeting:
	1. Begin to introduce winning states methods into the code.
	2. Correct the end of turn by count method.
	3. Add pop-up between spymaster and other team member's turn.
