Meeting Minutes for March 30th:

Meeting Attendance:
	1. Justin Cappiello
	2. Robert Straub [M]
	3. Abdullah Abaddi
	4. Aritra Paul
	
Tasks Completed Since Last Meeting:
	1. Build path for the GUI has been improved on by Justin.
	2. Comments have been added for the GUI.
	
Tasks Worked Upon but not Completed:
	1. Methods have started to be divided by the group, check google doc to see.
		- Google doc also includes a table showing the panels and what each panel should contain, added by Justin.
	2. Comments on GUI are more descriptive and easier to follow.
	3. Ideas for the GUI:
		- Aritra suggests adding a GUI on top of the existing GUI when it is not the spymaster's turn.
		  this would work by when the guesser hits an 'ok' button to complete their guess the board
		  switches back to the one with all the colors representing 'red', 'blue', 'bystander', 'assassin'.

Goals for Next Meeting:
	1. Divide up remaining methods needed for the GUI amongst group.
	2. Complete all methods needed to allow the spymaster's turn to be completed.
	3. Be able to move to the other player on the team's turn.
	4. Begin to implement action-listeners.
	
Scheduled Next Meeting(s):
	1. Sometime next week
